[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a Python packaging and dependency management tool.

In this app we use Poetry to deploy the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [quick start](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) example to [Render](https://render.com).

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://flask-poetry.onrender.com](https://flask-poetry.onrender.com).
